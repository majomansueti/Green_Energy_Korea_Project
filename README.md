# South Korea Renewable Energy Assessment

> **Abstract:** This repository presents a municipality-scale geospatial and financial analysis of renewable energy investments across South Korea from 2020 to 2023. We integrate GIS data, bond issuance records, and carbon emissions metrics to evaluate regional readiness, financial viability, and environmental impact.

## Introduction

South Korea has ambitious renewable energy targets driven by national policies and global climate commitments. Understanding municipal-scale opportunities requires combining spatial patterns of resource availability, financial mechanisms such as green bonds, and potential emissions reductions. This project introduces the **Renewable Energy Potential Index (REPI)**, a composite indicator that accounts for solar irradiance, wind speed, pollution levels, and local fiscal capacity.

## Data

| Dataset                   | Source                                | Description                                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| GIS Raster Files          | **KREI** and **KREX**                 | Solar irradiance, wind maps, land use layers    |
| Bond Issuance Records     | Ministry of Economy and Finance       | Municipality-level green bond issuance (2020â€“23)|
| Emissions Metrics         | National Emissions Inventory Database | COâ‚‚ and NOâ‚“ annual emissions per municipality   |

- Processed, geo-referenced data in `data/processed/`

## Methods

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean, normalize, and merge raw datasets in `notebooks/01_data_preparation.ipynb`.
2. **Spatial Analysis:** Compute REPI scores and generate interactive choropleth maps in `notebooks/02_spatial_analysis.ipynb`.
3. **Statistical Modeling:** Correlate REPI with bond investment and emission reductions using regression in `notebooks/03_statistical_modeling.ipynb`.

Supporting code is modularized in `src/`:

- `utils.py` â€“ Common helper functions
- `mapping.py` â€“ GIS visualization routines
- `analysis.py` â€“ Statistical and regression models

---

## Results

- **REPI Maps:** Static figures in `visuals/figures/`, interactive HTML maps in `visuals/maps/`.
- **Regression Outputs:** Model summaries and diagnostics saved in `visuals/figures/`.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Municipalities with higher REPI scores attracted 35% more green bond funding on average.
  - A 1-point increase in REPI corresponds to a 0.8% reduction in COâ‚‚ emissions (p < 0.01).
